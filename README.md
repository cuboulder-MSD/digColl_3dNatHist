# 3D Natural History Digital Collection
## Description
This collection is comprised of archaeology &amp; paleontology specimens from the Rocky Mountain &amp; Southwest regions, including baskets, moccasins, animal figurines, game pieces, jewelry, tools, and other everyday objects from the Freemont, Clovis, &amp; Ancestral Puebloan cultures as well as a selection of vertebrate, invertebrate and track paleontology specimens from the Mesozoic through the Cenozoic Eras (250 Ma - present).

This project is a collaboration between the University of Colorado Boulder's Museum of Natural History, University Libraries, &amp; the Colorado State Library. This program was funded in part with a grant from the Institute of Museum &amp; Library Services which administers the Library Services &amp; Technology Act.
